String utility command
======
This command aims to add functionality which the default execute command lacks. Specifically, checking if a string equals another string. You can do this with a few hacky solutions in vanilla, but this executes as a single command. 


Command documentation:
Checks if a string equals another string:::

- /string equals storage <storage id> <path> <match>    - Checks a storage object (/data)
- /string equals entity <entity> <path> <match>         - Checks an entity's nbt
