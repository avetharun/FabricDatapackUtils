Global Events
======
These kinds of events are for actions a player or entity does (for example, crouching or jumping) and will pass the player into the DPUDataStorage storage.


Names of event files (ie, eventname.json) do not matter, as it will execute any file under the event_name/ path.


Valid events as of version 1.0.2:
-----

- on_sneak

- while_sneak

-on_sneak_end

- on_jump

- on_eat


* Note: some events may not be defined in your version.
